# Node-Based Workflows
## Introduction
A few weeks ago I heard about n8n, which recently gained headway for being able to create agentic workflows. I wasn't familiar with the idea of an "agentic" workflow, particualtly a node-based one, so I decided to look into it. In short, **n8n** lets you plug any LLM (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, etc...) directly insto a visual workflow as a reusable "AI Agent" node that can reason, remember context, and decide which tools or actions to call next. This AI agent's ability to dynamically plan and execute multi-step tasks is known as an **agentic workflow**.

## Getting Started
I followed this tutorial on Youtube [n8n Tutorial for Beginners - Build Your First Free AI Agent](https://youtu.be/dpoMEcXjVH8?si=IscKdNpBLCBB3JnI) to get started on creating an AI Agent in n8n. 

n8n gave me the option "Test a simple AI Agent example"
## How it works
